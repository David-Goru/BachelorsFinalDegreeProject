# Game description
Since the Great Fire happened, La Acacia has been in balance separating virtue from danger, prosperity from ruin, the human race from the dark beings, and the North from the South. 

A constant war, started several millennia ago, confronts the most privileged with the dark. Both sides have the same objective: to unify the continent towards their side. 

The North is protected by the Summit of the Wizards, chosen for their skills and potential and made the most powerful in the upper half of La Acacia.

The South, however, is invaded by the so-called dark beasts, who have controlled every corner of their side, taming - with dark magic - all living beings in their way.

A few years ago, a spy wizards team managed to penetrate deep into the hot, dangerous and heavily populated lands of the South, discovering something that could defeat the North and end the war.
